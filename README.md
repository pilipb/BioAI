# BioAI
 
A solution to sustainable forestry through bio-inspired route planning.


## Layers

- tree density
- elevation / slope
- habitat / species / biodiversity / age of tree


## How?

- user would select a starting point and a destination over an area of interest
- the algorithm would find the best route to take based on the layers

## The algorithm

- we will use existing algorithms to create the layers
- we will use the slime mould algorithm as it is a bio-inspired algorithm that has been proven to be effective in finding the shortest path between two points. this will be applied to the combined layers to find the best route to take.
