alpha: Controls the influence of the pheromone trail.
beta: Controls the influence of the visibility (distance in this case).
rho: Evaporation rate of the pheromone trail.
q: Constant used to update the pheromone trail.

Here's a brief explanation of their effects:

alpha:
Increasing alpha makes the ants more likely to follow the pheromone trail, which means the algorithm will focus more on exploiting the current best solutions.
Decreasing alpha will make the ants less likely to follow the pheromone trail, leading to more exploration and possibly finding new, better solutions.

beta:
Increasing beta makes the ants more likely to move towards nodes that are closer, based on the heuristic (distance).
Decreasing beta will make the ants less likely to consider the distance, leading to more exploitation of the pheromone trail.

rho:
A higher rho value means the pheromone will evaporate slower, allowing the algorithm to remember the previous paths for a longer time.
A lower rho value makes the pheromone evaporate faster, leading to less memory of previous paths.

q:
A higher q value will increase the pheromone update, potentially intensifying the search around the better solutions.
A lower q value will decrease the pheromone update, making the ants less likely to reinforce the pheromone trail.
